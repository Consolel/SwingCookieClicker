# SwingCookieClicker
A Java Swing cookie clicker clone made by Console in about 3 weeks. (2022) 
This was alot of fun to make, learned a bunch about java.
I originally made this in BlueJ (a very basic editor) but started using stuff like Eclipse and NetBeans at the end. Used VS Code through the entire thing for some of its features too. 
only the g's know how to open dev panel ;)
